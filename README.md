# Prime-Generator
Python script with functions for primality testing, prime generation, and Mersenne prime generation.

The current program implements a trial division algorithm for primality testing.

In future updates, I plan to implement:
    - Lucas-Lehmer primality testing (similar to Prime95)
    - Support for generation of different classes of primes
    - A factorisation algorithm to list the integer divisors of nonprimes
    - General improvements to computational complexity
